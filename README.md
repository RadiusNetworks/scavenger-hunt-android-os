Beacon Scavenger Hunt for Android
=============================

The Beacon Scavenger Hunt lets you set up your own custom scavenger hunt game for  Android devices. Simply place AltBeacons at target locations, and configure their identifiers with the app.

You may either create a custom app based on our open source examples for Android, or by use our own app available in the app stores. If you decide to use our app you can set up an 8-digit hunt code to share with your particpants. Your scavenger hunt can be up and going in just a couple of hours!

Scavenger hunts are great team building events at conferences and meetings. And they are perfect for trade shows or other venues to encourage people to visit far flung areas.

The app is built on top of our Proximity Kit cloud service for AltBeacons, which makes it possible to do all your app's AltBeacon configuration in the cloud. This configurability is what makes creating different Beacon Scavenger Hunts with the same app possible.

##Building the App

The app may be built using Android Studio 1.0.1 and Gradle 2.2.1. Other versions of this software may not compile. Make sure to have Android build tools version 19.1.0 downloaded into your Android SDK Manager as well. 

To build the app, unzip the project file, open Android Studio and select Import Project. Select the build.gradle file within the top level of the project folder and hit OK. Click the Run button or select Run 'app' from the Run dropdown menu on the top bar.
